So we have both css and gsap to trigger page-load animations


[data-hero] is the parent to wrap - set attribute then adds [data-state=activated] on page-load from /app.js



we have a [data-split=lines] - to text-split and add a .line-in class. [data-animation=fade-in-up]



.side-nav w--current

.siide-nav-dot
